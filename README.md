## 👋 Welcome

What I couldn’t find, I built — and what I built, I shared.  

Most of my libraries started from a gap: I needed low-level, reliable tools in Node.js — but they didn’t exist, or weren’t production-ready.  
So I built my own, and released them as open source.  

My vision is to **strengthen the Node.js ecosystem at its foundations** by providing **low-level protocol and infrastructure libraries**.  
This way, developers can stay in Node.js and JavaScript — without having to switch to heavier languages or using third-party software — while still building **fast, modern, and production-grade systems**.  

Open source takes time, energy, and passion.  
If you’d like to support me and my work, you can do so through **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/colocohen)**.  
Your encouragement helps me stay motivated and keep creating libraries that benefit the entire community.  

🧢 *So Let’s Make Node.js Great Again* - with high quailty infrastructure libraries 🦾


## Projects

- ⚡ [quico](https://github.com/colocohen/quico)  
  The **first full QUIC and HTTP/3 implementation for Node.js**.  
  Bringing next-generation internet protocols directly to JavaScript developers for ultra-fast networking and cutting-edge experimentation.

- 🍋 [lemon-tls](https://github.com/colocohen/lemon-tls)  
  TLS implementation in pure JavaScript.  
  exposing handshake internals and modern cryptography to Node.js developers. 

- 🌐 [dnssec-server](https://github.com/colocohen/dnssec-server)  
  The **first open-source DNS server for Node.js with full DNSSEC support**.  
  Lightweight, developer-friendly, and designed to make secure multi-domain management simple.

- 🎥 [stable-webrtc](https://github.com/colocohen/stable-webrtc)  
  A production-ready WebRTC library that solves the real-world headaches of vanilla WebRTC: signaling chaos, dropped connections, and multi-context confusion.  
  It was built to make peer-to-peer connections finally stable in production environments.

  
## Coming Soon

- 📧 A **developer-friendly mail server** for Node.js — send and receive email without the heavy setup of traditional mail software.
